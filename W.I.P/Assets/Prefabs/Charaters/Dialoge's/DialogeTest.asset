        dialogueText: The BCAN 1C features a highly advanced hydropneumatic suspension
          system, allowing it to adjust its height for better stability during firing
          or mobility across rugged terrain. This ability not only makes it more
          effective in combat but also gives it a futuristic look as it "kneels"
          before unleashing its powerful 155mm gun!
